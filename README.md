# HellDivers2 LoupDeck AutoHotKey
AutoHotKey scripts for HellDivers2.
Created for Razer Stream Controller X because input setup in LoopDeck is not detected in game.
These scripts are separated into 2 scripts sets.
The first set contains the stratagem code, which calls the second script which parses given code and sends the input.
This also is configured to use arrow keys for the stratagems.

You will also be able to import the profile I use but will need to change the paths to your user path.
